I was not sure what exactly the bonus had to do, so this is how I interpreted it:

1.  The user inputs two cities: A and B.
2.  Then, for each city (call it C) other than A and B, find all valid one-stop connection flights from A to B through
	C. A valid one-stop connection flight contains a flight from A to C and a flight from C to B.
3.  Calculate the average arrival delay over the one-stop connection flights from A to B, for each city C (for each
	one-stop connection flight, its arrival delay is the arrival delay of the second flight from C to B).
4.  Return the one-stop connection flight with the minimal average arrival delay (which is made of cities A and B,
	and the city with the minimal average arrival delay that connects them).

I also had to decide what a valid one-stop connection is. So I decided that it is every two flights from city to A
to city C and from city C to city B such that:

1.  The actual arrival time (planned arrival time + arrival delay) of the flight from city A to city C is at least an
	hour before the planned departure time of the flight from city C to city B.
2.	The planned arrival time of the flight from city A to city C is not 24 hours or more before the planned departure
	time of the flight from city C to city B.
